#Funny Factorials - 300
Keith has discovered a mysterious piece of paper, containing a mysterious formula:
x^2 + (5/3)x^3 + (23/12)x^4 + (119/60)x^5 ... + (2*[5000!-1]/[5000!])x^5000


Keith was curious, and so decided to evaluate the expression for x=0.7893
What number was returned, to the nearest 20 decimal places?

This can be simplified to sum((2-2/n!)*.7893^n) from n=2 to 5000

Plug this in to Wolphram Alpha!
